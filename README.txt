This project is a demo implementation of java web services. Here it were implemented several 
clients of web services and you interact with them in a web page fashion. The next urls 
represent the original services avaiable and the corresponding web page, for testing purposes.

To build the project you need to run the file named "build.xml" and you can find this on the 
main folder. Inside the "dist" folder you have a bash file with a command to deploy the 
"war" file on the heroku cloud service under the project country-info.

The WebContent file has the front-end files of the project and the src has the server side.
The web services implementation is under the "src" folder. Many of the code is automatically 
generated by eclipse and by the Axis web services library. The code that was hand coded is 
documented in a javadoc style and is under the package "org.webservice.countryInfo". 
You should be cautious because  some, under this package, are auto-generated by eclipse and Axis framework.
